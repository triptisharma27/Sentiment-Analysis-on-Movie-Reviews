Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Overview

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to determine the sentiment of textual movie reviews. It categorizes sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, offering insights into audience opinions and reactions. The project is designed to process large datasets of reviews and is suitable for applications like recommendation systems or feedback analysis.

Key Features:

Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses textual data for effective analysis.

NLP Techniques: Uses libraries like NLTK and others for tokenization, stop-word removal, and sentiment scoring.

Machine Learning Models: Implements classification models to predict sentiment.

Scalable Design: Handles large datasets of reviews efficiently.

Contents of the Notebook:

Importing Dependencies: Essential libraries like pandas, os, and nltk are used for data handling and text processing.

Data Loading: Reads and combines review data from multiple sources.

Preprocessing: Applies techniques like lowercasing, stop-word removal, and tokenization.

Feature Extraction: Converts textual data into numerical representations for modeling.

Model Training and Evaluation: Implements and evaluates machine learning models for sentiment prediction.

Visualization: Generates insights through visual representation of data and model performance.

Applications:

Recommendation Systems: Tailors content suggestions based on audience sentiment.

Customer Feedback Analysis: Understands user opinions to improve services.

Market Research: Assesses public sentiment towards movies or media.
